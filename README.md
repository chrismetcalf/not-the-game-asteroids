Sample app for [Space Apps Next Gen NYC](http://spaceappsnextgen.com/). Visualizes asteroid impacts over time.

TODO (left to the reader):

- Time scale impacts by year, rather than just having them show up every two seconds
- Give the user some control to filter what shows up - weight, material, time frame, etc.
- Allow the user to pause and restart the playback if they want to explore
- Make it look prettier!
